To download MakeRoll click the following link and download the "latest release", at the moment is the 1.1.0-beta0, this may seem confusing because it is a beta, but it is the recommended version: https://github.com/mauriziospaccialbelli/MakeRoll/releases

MakeRoll is a really cool spool holder for 3d printing, first let's see the features already implemented in MakeRoll:

- Very compact!
- It adapts easily and quickly to any type of spool, of different weight, width and diameter of the spool and filament! To give you an idea, it works with spools from 250gr up to 3-4kg). Same thing if you have to insert a coil between other coils already placed, the movements to be made will be quick and easy.
- Integrated dust filter on each spool.
- The MakeRoll system can be easily placed in cabinets or boxes that are dehumidified or not. A next upgrade will be the placement on above of the printer.
- Printable and replicable, in fact it is designed to be a RepRap project (and 100% free).

Other upgrades I've sketched out are: Filament buffer for Anti-tangle, and rolling to the center hole for the spools.

MakeRoll is a [RepRap](http://reprap.org/wiki/MakeRoll) project born by Maurizio Spaccialbelli(MaurinoWeb) and Marco Spaccialbelli.
