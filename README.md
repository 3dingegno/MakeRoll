**MakeRoll** is a universal, easy and adjustable system for scrolling spool in 3d printing fff/fdm.

The system is compact and uses openbuilds profiles, bearings, nuts, bolts and printed parts.

With MakeRoll you can use spools of 250 grams up to 4 kilos only with simple and few steps, you can put it in a box or make a filament cabinet. The distance between the spools is only 15mm.
The position of the spools is easily changed without using any tools, the system is adaptable to the diameter and width of the spools... the printed parts do a lot of work for us ;-)
We recommend a maximum width of 100cm.

MakeRoll has an integrated dust filter for each spool, and is removable without removing the filament. Work on filaments 1.75mm and 2.85mm.

For now MakeRoll works with most of the filaments on the market, if there were any filaments that are not compatible with MakeRoll, please report it, thanks.

Tips for print yours MakeRoll:

Each piece of MakeRoll is designed and tested to be printed at 0.3mm layer height with 0.4mm nozzle, without any rotation, so print them in the same position they are in.. downloading them from here, choosing the extension you prefer:

[Download MakeRoll.zip](https://github.com/3dingegno/MakeRoll/archive/1.0.1.zip)

[Download MakeRoll.tar.gz](https://github.com/3dingegno/MakeRoll/archive/1.0.1.tar.gz)

For now I have not tested any mod or modification that you find in the following links, however it is recommended to continue reading...

The tolerance of the interlocking pieces is 0.1mm on each side, sufficient for well set printers, but some may have problems (I am considering increasing the tolerance) anyway now you have the possibility to download the interlocking pieces with a tolerance increased by 0.2mm, from the following link kindly offered by thedragonlord (Andrea Agostini), which I thank:

The complete list with the number of prints and components has been lost together with the site that I have to get back online, but Alfredo Abate, whom I personally thank, has kindly written a small guide that can help:

If you have any BQ spools or similar (with different diameters) or simply prefer a central attachment, you can download the MOD for MakeRoll kindly offered by Guppy75, I take this opportunity to thank him:
